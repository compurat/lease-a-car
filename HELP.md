# Getting Started
I used a .env file with vars on my local machine to hide the database credentials.
The .env file is not included in the project.
create a .env file src/main/docker of the project with the following content:
DB_USERNAME=<username>
DB_PASSWORD=<password>

If you run it from intellij or eclipse, you need to set the env vars in the run configuration.
If you run it from the command line, you need to set the env vars in the command line:
mac and linux with: export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
windows with: for /f "usebackq tokens=1,2 delims==" %A in (.env) do set %A=%B
after that you can run the project with mvn ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev (after a clean install)
Docker-compose has a build-in support for the .env file.

run the docker-compose start -d under the folder src/main/docker
to start the database.

Then build the project with mvn clean install
Then run the project with ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
import all the tests in Postman with [svb.postman_collection.json] you find in the root of the project.
Then run http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cars/load/all and http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cars/load/interest/rates
to setup the database correctly with all the cars and interests.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the
parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
